# HTML Gran Canaria project
This was a project I had to during the first semester of the first year in college.

Our objective was to create a html site with multiple pages. It could be on anything and having been on holidays there that summer I did mine on a tourist site of Gran Canaria.

Keep in mind my understanding of coding was non-existant at the time.
